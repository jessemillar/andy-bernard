# andybernard
A simple Slack bot written to confuse the people who work in my office. Andy Bernard serves two purposes:

1) He responds to any message with one of six GIFs taken from scenes of The Office.

2) Andy lets everyone know it's time to go home with the clock strikes 4:59pm by posting a Spotify link to the song "Closing Time" as sung by Semisonic.

**Note:** Be sure to set the time offset in index.js so that the server knows what time 5pm is for your office (since your server may not be in the same timezone).
